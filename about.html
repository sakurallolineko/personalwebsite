  <h2>About this page</h2>
  <h3> Who am I?!
  </h3>
<div class= intro>
<p class= int> I am a person who's a MOBA and MMORPG gamer(League of Legends and
  used to play[sometimes still do] Aura kingdom, Eden Eternal and Mabinoji),
  but i'm not only into that, I also play other games in different consoles. I
  also enjoy watching anime and reading manga. My favorite sport to practice is
  soccer, but my favorite "fake"(everything in this world is fake so I don't
  know why people nag about wwe being fake) sport to watch is WWE since I was
  young.<br>
  Speaking of WWE, my favorite childhood shows were(and still are) Fostershome
  of Imaginary Friends(hipity hopity), Grims adventures of Billy and Mandy (that jamaican acsent
  tho), Edd Ed and Eddy, spongebob(can't wait for the brand new episode!)
  , and I have more but I seem to forget at times. I might draw
  recreations of them later, if I know how.
